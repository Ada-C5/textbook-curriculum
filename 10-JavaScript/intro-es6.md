# Intro to ES6
ES6 is shorthand for ECMAScript 6, which is the latest and greatest JavaScript release. This is the most relevant and recent release of a great number of features that JavaScript has introduced to give JAvaScript developers more tools in their toolbox.

## Learning Goals
- Understand how ES6 plays into JavaScript overall
- See examples of ED6 features including:
  - Arrow functions
  - Classes
  - Template literals
  - `let`
  - `const`

## Compatibility
One of the reasons why it has been difficult to introduce the ES6 features is because the implementation of these features across browsers has been inconsistent. To get an idea of this inconsistency, you can view [the compatibility chart](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
